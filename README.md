# Workshop material for *Introduction to Bayesian Ecological Modelling*

*Under construction. More to come!*

This workshop is designed for a small group size and a room with whiteboard. It 
has a (_Statistical Rethinking_)[https://xcelab.net/rm/] (McElreath 2020) 
flavour to it, i.e., we are revisiting statistical tools and concepts rather 
than learning about it from scratch.

## Prerequisite

1. Undergraduate-level introductory biostatistics is useful, but not necessary
2. Basic `R` programming --- basically you've load and analysed some ecological
data before
3. Curiosity 

## Preparation

1. Please install the `brms` package following instructions [here](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms?tab=readme-ov-file#faq). 
After installation, please double check that you could run some of the example
codes in the helpfile `?brm`.
2. To facilitate our discussion sessions, it would be great if you could prepare
a dataset or research question that you're considering to analyse with 
Bayesian inference.
3. Laptop
3. Pen and paper
