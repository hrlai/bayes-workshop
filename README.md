# Workshop material for *Introduction to Bayesian Ecological Modelling*

*Under construction. More to come!*

This workshop is designed for a small group size to work in pairs, in a room 
with whiteboard. It has a [*Statistical Rethinking*](https://xcelab.net/rm/) 
(McElreath 2020) flavour to it, i.e., we are revisiting statistical tools 
and concepts rather than learning from scratch.

## Prerequisite

1. Undergraduate-level introductory biostatistics is useful, but not necessary
2. Basic `R` programming: you've loaded and analysed some ecological
data before 

## Preparation

1. Please install the `brms` package following instructions [here](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms?tab=readme-ov-file#faq). 
After installation, please double check that you could run some of the example
codes in the helpfile `?brm`.
2. Also install the `mvabund` package by `install.packages("mvabund")`
2. To facilitate our discussion sessions, it would be great if you could prepare
a dataset or research question that you're considering to analyse with 
Bayesian inference.
3. Laptop
4. Pen and paper
